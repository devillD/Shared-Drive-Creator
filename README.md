# Cautionâš 
Before you create one, i need to remind you that, the shared drive you gonna create is accessable by the admin of that Organization!

So, stay away from keeping personal data on shared drives.
# Benefit of having Shared drive
Shared drive provides huge amount of space, almost 400,000 files and folders.
where general(non buisness) drive space is only 15GB!
